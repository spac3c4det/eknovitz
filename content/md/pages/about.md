## Can oneself describe oneself?

As a kid and teenager I always loved playing computer games.
I thought to myself that whatever I would end up doing as a grown up - I
would want it to feel like I was playing.

Eventually simply being a "consumer" of the games got boring; so I started hacking
and modding them - and thus programming became my new favourite game to play.


I've kept at it ever since and with the exception of govermental/enterprise
contracting; I've never been bored with it.
